# dita-tools


!!! tip

    Always run Claude Code from a terminal in the root of the documentation repository you are working on. The dita-tools command operates on the current working directory, reading local files, checking git branches, and writing output relative to the repo root.

!!! warning

    Always validate your reworked content with the [AsciiDocDITA Vale style](https://github.com/jhradilek/asciidoctor-dita-vale) (`vale --config=.vale.ini --glob='*.adoc'`) before submitting a PR/MR for merge. The `/dita-rework` command runs Vale checks during the workflow, but you must confirm that no new issues have been introduced and all reported issues are resolved before merging.
